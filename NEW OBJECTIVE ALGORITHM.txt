OBJECTIVE: 
	1.	allow code to take input for different filing statuses
		single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household
	2.	allow code to calculate taxes for each tax bracket

ALGORITHM:
	1.	input filing status
	2.  input income
	3.	function to calculate taxes (one universal function that can accounts for bracket)
	4.  output tax amount, calculate % of total income


TAX	CALCULATION FUNCTION:
	1.	take inputted income
	2.	find which bracket it belongs to
	3.  calculate tax value for each bracket
	4.	calculate % of total income
	5.  output tax, tax % values


FINDING TAX BRACKET
	1.  Declare variables for upper bracket number per status and variables for tax rates
	2. 	class for tax brackets
			6 variables based on last number of each bracket
			int b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6
	3.  switch case:
			switch single
			case single:
			Class = s_bracket
			calculation

			case mfj:
			Class = mfj_bracket
			calculation

			case mfs:
			Class = mfs_bracket
			calculation

			etc...

CALCULATION FOR TAX (HOW DO WE COME UP WTIH GENERAL FORMULA FOR CALCULATING TOTAL TAX)
we could just do conditional if, else if, else statements for each bracket but
to challenge ourselfves lets try to create a loop that can do it, to simplify code. we know that
	bracket 1: income < b1
	tax = inc * r1

	bracket 2: income < b2
	b1*r1 + r2* (inc - b1)
	
	bracket 3: income < b3
	b1*r1 + r2 (b2-b1) + r3(inc - b3)

GUESS
	b1*r1 (if scenario)

	else
	b1*r1 + r2(inc-b1)
	b1*r1 + r2(b2-b1) + r3(inc - b3)

	starting at b1*r1 add tax rate * (income - bracket 1)
	


PSEUDOCODE
	if bracket = sin_bracket
	tax = r1 * inc
	else
		switch status
			case mfj
			bracket = mfj_bracket
			case mjs

			case hoh

FUTURE DESIRED FUNCTIONALITY
	alter tax bracket
		1. ask if default tax bracket is okay
		2. if yes, continue with code
		   if no, manually enter tax infor
		3. 


WHAT I LEARNED
	switch function if desired variable is exactly = an int, char, string
	if, else if, else if desired if variable is within a range
