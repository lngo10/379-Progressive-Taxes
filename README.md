This project started out as a simple tax calculator from this reddit challenge
https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/cdieag/20190715_challenge_379_easy_progressive_taxation/

Now, this tax calculator can estimate taxes for the actual 2019 tax bracket for people filing as single.

The married (jointly), married (separately), and head of household filing statuses will be added very shortly.

I am currently expanding the project to allow the user to input a custom tax bracket. Afterwards the goal will be to simplify the code.
